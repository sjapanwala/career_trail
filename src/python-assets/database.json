We are seeking candidates with research expertise in (1\\) general\\-purpose hardware such as accelerators for AI and ML, high\\-performance computing, low\\-power edge computing, quantum computing, cybersecurity, chiplets, and CPU, TPU, GPU, and FPGA systems; or (2\\) custom ASICs (e.g. Analog/Mixed\\-Signal/Digital Integrated Circuits) such as neuromorphic chips, high\\-speed wireless/wireline communication links (5G/6G and beyond, 100\\-400 GBPS links), ultra\\-low\\-power circuits for IoT, interface circuits for quantum computers, system\\-in\\-package, and advanced IC packaging technologies.\n\n\nThe University of Alberta\u2019s strategic plan (Shape: The University Strategic Plan 2023\\-2033\\) highlights expanding interdisciplinary research as a key initiative. Joining our department means collaboration opportunities with researchers and instructors across numerous departments at the University of Alberta. Some particularly common collaborations are with the Departments of Computing Science, Mechanical Engineering, and Physics, but many others are also possible. As a new faculty member, you will also have the opportunity to collaborate with researchers at University research centers such as the Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (AMII), the Institute for Space Science, Exploration and Technology (ISSET), the Institute for Smart Augmentative and Restorative Technologies and Health Innovations (iSMART), and the Centre for Mathematics Science and Technology Education (CMASTE), among others.\n\n\nThe successful candidate will join a team of faculty members committed to an exceptional student experience. The Department has over 1000 undergraduate students across the electrical and computer programs that will grow in 2025 with the mechatronics program. There are opportunities to engage with students in and out of the classroom in research laboratories, capstone projects, and student clubs and teams like Mission Space Walker, UAlberta Solar Car, AlbertaSAT, and the IEEE Student Branch. The Department\u2019s graduate program attracts students who are dedicated to developing in their area of expertise from schools worldwide and presently has an enrolment of over 450 students, including approximately 220 Ph.D. students. Through hands\\-on experiences in state\\-of\\-the\\-art labs and instruction from skilled faculty, we help students develop the skills they need to dream of and invent the technology of the future. More information is available on our website.\n\n\nAs we build our team, we recognize that our people are and will continue to be our greatest strength. Applicants who value working across disciplinary boundaries, within and outside engineering, as well as with communities and industry are strongly encouraged to apply. If you are looking to join a Faculty with a growing focus on computer engineering, we welcome your application!\n\n**The Role and Responsibilities**\n\n\nThe Assistant Professor role is the starting point on the academic faculty member career pathway at the University of Alberta.

An Academic Faculty member may decide on specific course content and instructional methodology, recognizing the approved course description, and academic policy approved by the Department, the Faculty, and the University. Teaching is year\\-round with most courses in the Fall (September to December) and Winter (January to April) semesters. Teaching assignments are decided in discussion with the Department Chair. As the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board accredits the undergraduate degree programs in our Faculty, licensure as a Professional Engineer or Licensee in Alberta is required. Licensure must be obtained within five years of the hire date.*\n* **Research (40%)**: *Participation in research, including the preparation or performance of creative works and reflective inquiry, and disseminating research results by means appropriate to the discipline. Academic Faculty members are encouraged to seek funding for research from granting agencies or other sources.*\n* **Service (20%)**: *An Academic Faculty member shall be actively engaged in service to the University and participate in the collegial responsibilities of departmental, Faculty, and University governance. Provision of service to the discipline of the Academic Faculty member; participation in the governance of the University, the Faculty, and the Department, and dissemination of knowledge to the general public by making available the Academic Faculty member\u2019s expertise and knowledge of the discipline.*\n\n\nThe Department Chair supervises Faculty Members. Annually, Faculty Members prepare and submit a report of their university responsibilities to the Department Chair and the Dean. We offer a competitive market salary. For information about the responsibilities, salary, benefits, leaves, and related details, see the most recent collective agreement for academic faculty members.\n\n**About the Faculty of Engineering and the University of Alberta**\n\n\nThe Faculty of Engineering aims to maintain its position among the top schools in North America. We will do this through innovation and excellence from faculty members and staff who value collaboration, interdisciplinary work, and an engaging and positive work culture.
